This website is a site I plan to continue working on and eventually host for my growing side work. It will make it easier for me to manage and gather potential clients. The site includes a gallery of images of jobs I've worked on as well as calculator for quotes and an email form to get in contact with me for work.

CSS feature list:
1. A hamburger menu to navigate to other pages on the site.
2. Used Flexbox and CSS grid elements to change the way content is displayed on the screen for different sized devices

JavaScript feature list:
1. I created an email contact form that uses JavaScript to validate that text was entered and sends an email to me.
2. Quote calculator to get potential clients an approxamation on how much my servies will cost
